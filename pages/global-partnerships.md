title: Revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development
goalNum: 17
name: Partnerships for the Goals
description: >-
  A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between
  governments, the private sector and civil society. These inclusive
  partnerships built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared
  goals that place people and the planet at the centre, are needed at the
  global, regional, national and local level.


  The UN has defined 19 "Targets" and 25 "Indicators" for SDG 17. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
