title: 'Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable'
goalNum: 11
name: Sustainable Cities and Communities
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/): <q>The
  challenges cities face can be overcome in ways that allow them to continue to
  thrive and grow, while improving resource use and reducing pollution and
  poverty. The future we want includes cities of opportunities for all, with
  access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more.</q>


  The UN has defined 10 _Targets_ and 15 _Indicators_ for SDG 11. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
