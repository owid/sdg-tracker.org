title: Promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent
  work for all
goalNum: 8
name: Decent Work and Economic Growth
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/economic-growth/):
  <q>Roughly half the world’s population still lives on the equivalent of about
  US$2 a day. And in too many places, having a job doesn’t guarantee the ability
  to escape from poverty. This slow and uneven progress requires us to rethink
  and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty.</q>


  The UN has defined 12 _Targets_ and 17 _Indicators_ for SDG 8. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
