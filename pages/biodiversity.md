  Sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land
  degradation, halt biodiversity loss
goalNum: 15
name: Life on Land
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/biodiversity/):
  <q>Forests cover 30 per cent of the Earth’s surface and in addition to
  providing food security and shelter, forests are key to combating climate
  change, protecting biodiversity and the homes of the indigenous population. 
  Thirteen million hectares of forests are being lost every year while the
  persistent degradation of drylands has led to the desertification of 3.6
  billion hectares.</q>


  The UN has defined 12 _Targets_ and 14 _Indicators_ for SDG 15. Targets
  specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims
  to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text
  of all <i>Targets</i> and show the data on the agreed <i>Indicators</i>.

            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 15.1.1 is <q>forest area as a proportion of total land area</q>.<p>Forest area is land under natural or planted stands of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and trees in urban parks and gardens.</p>

Three sub-indicators focus on the extension of forest area, biomass within the forest area and protection and maintenance of biological diversity. One relates to the availability of a long-term management plan; and the final measures areas which are independently verified for compliance with a set of national or international standards.</p>
