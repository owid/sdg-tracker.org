title: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
goalNum: 13
name: Climate Action
description: >-
  Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to
  leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. The pace of change is
  quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other
  measures that will reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.


  Further data and statistics can be found at the <i>Our World in Data</i> entry
  on [CO<sub>2</sub> and Other Greenhouse Gas
  Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).


  The UN has defined 5 "Targets" and 8 "Indicators" for SDG 13. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
