title: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
goalNum: 5
name: Gender Equality
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/):
  <i><q>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary
  foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. 


  Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent
  work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes
  will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at
  large.</q></i>


  The UN has defined 9 _Targets_ and 14 _Indicators_ for SDG 5. Targets specify
  the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to
  track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of
  all <i>Targets</i> and show the data on the agreed <i>Indicators</i>.
