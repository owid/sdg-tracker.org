title: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
goalNum: 5
name: Gender Equality
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/):
  _"Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary
  foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world._


  _Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large."_


  The UN has defined 9 _Targets_ and 14 _Indicators_ for SDG 5. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.
