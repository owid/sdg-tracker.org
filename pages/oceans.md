title: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources
goalNum: 14
name: Life below Water
description: >-
  The [UN explains](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/oceans/): _"Our
  oceans — their temperature, circulation, chemistry, and ecosystems  — play a
  fundamental role in making Earth habitable._


  _Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation. Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable future."_


  The UN has defined 10 _Targets_ and 10 _Indicators_ for SDG 14. Targets specify the goals and Indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these Targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all Targets and show the data on the agreed Indicators.

            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Indicator 14.4.1 is the <q>proportion of fish stocks within biologically sustainable levels</q>.<p>This indicator measures the proportion of global fish stocks which are overexploited, fully exploited and not fully exploited. Sustainable levels of fish stocks are those which are underexploited or fully exploited. Overexploited fish stocks are unsustainable.<p> A fish stock with abundance equal to or above the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is classified as biologically sustainable. When abundance falls below the MSY level, the stock is considered biologically unsustainable. </p>
            <p><strong>Goal:</strong> <q>By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield</q>.<p>Unlike most SDG targets, which have a target year of 2030, this indicator is set to be achieved by 2020.</p>
